After cloning, cd into the hotel_safe dir and run ./setup.sh.  An alias for hotel_safe should be added to your ~/.bash_aliases file.

To use, simply cd into the directory containing the assets (FOLDERS ONLY, not files) you want locked in the safe.  Then, run `hotel_safe lock` and follow the instructions.

To unlock, cd into the parent directory containing the safe file, and run `hotel_safe unlock`.

hotel_safe will lock/unlock the same assets each time after you set up any folder.  If you'd like to change how a folder locks/unlocks itself, run `hotel_safe setup` from within that folder to change what you'd like.
